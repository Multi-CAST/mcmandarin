    "description": "The Multi-CAST **Mandarin** (Modern Standard Mandarin; [mand1415](https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/mand1415)) corpus consists of traditional narratives from three native speakers of Mandarin. They were recorded in X\u012b'\u0101n, PRC, by Maria Vollmer during an exchange semester in 2015 and 2016. Two of the speakers are originally from Northeast China (D\u014dngb\u011bi), the third hails from X\u012b'\u0101n.\n\nThe stories were transcribed by Liu Ruoyu in 2016 and 2017 under the supervision of Maria Vollmer, and subsequently translated, glossed, and annotated with GRAID between 2016 and 2019 by Maria Vollmer. Annotations with RefIND and ISNRef were added by Maria Vollmer and Adrian Kuqi in 2019. Further stories have been recorded and transcribed and will be added to the corpus in the future.",
